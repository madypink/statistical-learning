# ðŸ’» Statistical Learning Project: Laptop Price Prediction & Clustering

This repository contains a project completed for the course **Statistical Learning** at the **University of Milan**, as part of the Masterâ€™s program in *Data Science for Economics*.  

The project applies **both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques** to analyze laptop specifications and prices. The main focus is on predicting laptop prices using regression models and clustering similar laptops based on their hardware characteristics.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:
- To perform **data visualization** to explore patterns and trends in laptop specifications and prices.  
- To apply **data preprocessing** techniques:
  - Handling missing values  
  - Standardizing numerical features  
  - Encoding categorical features  
- To apply **supervised learning algorithms** for predicting laptop prices.  
- To apply **unsupervised learning algorithms** for clustering similar laptops.  
- To evaluate model performance and interpret results to ensure accuracy and meaningful insights.
